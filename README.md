# APCSPlaylist

Welcome to the ultimate music playlist project! Here, you can add all your favorite songs and even like them, but be careful not to remove them by accident.

With our easy-to-use interface, you can add, like, and remove songs with just a click of a button. Plus, you can examine all the songs in your playlist, check out a sublist of only your "liked" songs, and even determine the total duration of your playlist.

But watch out for the "unliked" songs, because with our powerful "remove all" feature, they'll be gone in the blink of an eye. Just be careful not to remove any elements from the list that you actually want to keep (like that one song you only kind of like).


FOR RWHITE:
git commits may look wonky because we used liveshare  (google docs but for coding).
